# How to Release Lua Telemetry

This documents the release process for maintainers. It reflects what actually
builds and ships today (`Makefile` + `.github/workflows/`), not the legacy
`release` shell script at the repo root, which predates the current
`WIDGETS/`-based layout and is no longer used by CI or by the release
workflow.

## Versioning

There is a single source of truth for the version number: the `VERSION`
string in `src/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/iNav.lua`:

```lua
local VERSION = "2.4"
```

This is what the widget displays on the transmitter, and it's also what the
`Makefile` reads to name build output (`make print-version`, or
`grep VERSION src/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/iNav.lua`). There is no separate
version file — bumping this string *is* bumping the version.

**Bump this before tagging, not after.** If you tag first and bump later,
the tagged commit's source disagrees with what ships in the zip asset built
from a later commit (this happened with the 2.4 release — see "Lessons from
the 2.4 release" below).

### Tag naming

Use `vX.Y.Z` (three-part semver, `v` prefix) — e.g. `v2.4.0`. Past tags have
been inconsistent (`v2.2.0`, `v.2.3.0` with a stray dot, and `2.4` with no
prefix at all), which is exactly why `release.yml`'s tag trigger currently
has to match more than one pattern (see below). Stick to `vX.Y.Z` going
forward so the trigger doesn't need further patching.

## What gets built

`make dist` and `make dist-lua` are two independent targets — `dist` does
not depend on `dist-lua`, so building one does not build the other:

- **`make dist`** — compiles every `.lua` file under `src/SCRIPTS/` and
  `src/WIDGETS/` to stripped bytecode (`luac -s`) and zips it as
  `dist/LuaTelemetry_v<VERSION>.zip`. This is what most users install.
- **`make dist-lua`** — zips the raw, uncompiled `src/` tree as-is, no
  compilation, as `dist/LuaTelemetry_v<VERSION>_lua.zip`. Needed for
  EdgeTX 2.11rc1+ (which broke loading precompiled Lua) and for the
  simulator.

Both files are added to `src/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/iNav/*.lua` etc. via
wildcard, so **new view files (e.g. `tx15.lua`, `tx16s.lua`) are picked up
automatically** — no Makefile changes needed when adding a new screen
layout.

To build both locally:

```bash
make dist dist-lua
```

Both zips land in `dist/`.

## Automated builds

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — runs on every PR and push, builds both
  zip variants (`make dist dist-lua`) as a CI artifact. Doesn't touch
  releases.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — runs on a tag push matching `v*` or
  a bare `X.Y*` numeric tag (`[0-9]+.[0-9]+*`), builds both zips, and
  uploads them to the GitHub release matching that tag name via
  `svenstaro/upload-release-action`.

**A release only gets assets automatically if the tag matches one of those
two patterns.** If you tag something that doesn't match (e.g. a typo, or
some future new format), the workflow silently never fires — GitHub won't
warn you, the release will just have zero assets. Always check
`gh release view <tag> --repo iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget` after
tagging to confirm assets showed up (see checklist below).

## Release procedure

1. **Bump `VERSION`** in `src/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/iNav.lua` and merge that to
   `master` (PR, same as any other change).
2. **Tag the merged commit** with `vX.Y.Z`:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z <merged-commit-sha>
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
   Or via `gh` without a local checkout:
   ```bash
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --repo iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget \
     --target <merged-commit-sha> --title "vX.Y.Z <short description>" \
     --generate-notes
   ```
3. **Wait ~30s, then verify the workflow ran and assets attached:**
   ```bash
   gh run list --repo iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget --workflow=release.yml --limit 1
   gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget
   ```
   Confirm both `LuaTelemetry_v<version>.zip` and
   `LuaTelemetry_v<version>_lua.zip` are listed as assets.
4. If assets are missing, the tag likely didn't match the trigger patterns,
   or the workflow failed. Check `gh run list` for a failed/missing run,
   fix (see Troubleshooting), and re-push the tag or manually build+upload:
   ```bash
   make clean-obj clean-zip
   make dist dist-lua
   gh release upload vX.Y.Z dist/*.zip --repo iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Tag was pushed pointing at the wrong commit (e.g. before a needed
version-bump or fix commit landed).** You can move a tag after the fact by
updating the underlying ref, as long as the release has no assets yet that
depend on the old target:
```bash
gh api -X PATCH repos/iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget/git/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z \
  -f sha="<correct-full-40-char-sha>" -F force=true
```
Moving the ref this way re-fires the tag-push event, so `release.yml` will
run again against the new commit automatically.

**`git push` denied with 403 even though `gh api .../permissions` shows full
push access.** A restricted `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var can pin `git`/`gh` to a
fine-grained PAT that blocks raw git push while still reporting full
permissions via the API. This is intentional (limits unattended agent
actions) — don't work around it without asking whoever is driving the
release first, every time, even if they approved it earlier in the same
session.

## Lessons from the 2.4 release

The `2.4` release was originally tagged and published with **zero assets**,
and the reasons compound into the process above:

- The tag `2.4` didn't match the old `release.yml` trigger (`v*` only), so
  the workflow never ran.
- Even if it had matched, the workflow only ran `make dist` — the
  `_lua.zip` asset (present on prior releases) had never been automated;
  someone had to build and upload it by hand every time.
- The `VERSION` string was never bumped before tagging, so the source at
  the tagged commit still said `2.3.0`.
- The tag was created before the version-bump/workflow-fix PR was merged,
  so it had to be moved to the correct commit afterward (see
  Troubleshooting above).

All four are now fixed: `release.yml` matches both tag conventions, builds
both zips, and this document exists so version-bump-before-tag isn't
rediscovered the hard way again.
